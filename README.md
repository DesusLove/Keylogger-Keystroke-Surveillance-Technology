# 🔐 **Advanced Keylogger**

---

## ❓ **What is a Keylogger?**
**Keystroke logging** — also known as **keylogging** or **keyboard capture** — is the **covert recording** of every keystroke made on a keyboard, typically without the user’s knowledge.  
The logged data can later be retrieved by the operator, making keyloggers a common tool for **stealing passwords, messages, and sensitive information**.

> ⚠️ Even **Microsoft** has publicly acknowledged that Windows 10 includes a built-in keylogger — purportedly “to improve typing and writing functions.”

## 🔧 **Types of Keyloggers**
Keyloggers are broadly categorized into two types:

### 🖥️ **Software-Based Keyloggers**
- Capture keystrokes **at the software/OS level**
- Can record **clipboard content**, **screenshots**, and **control text**
- Log **search queries**, **chat conversations**, **FTP transfers**, and **internet activity**
- Often run in the background as stealth processes

### 🔌 **Hardware-Based Keyloggers**
- Physical devices installed **between the keyboard and the computer**
- Begin logging **immediately upon system boot** (no software installation needed)
- Operate at the **hardware level**, making detection via software difficult
- Memory capacity can range from **KB to TB** (≈1 byte per keystroke)

## 🕵️ **How to Detect & Remove Keyloggers**
Detection depends on the keylogger's sophistication:

### 🔍 **Signs of a Poorly-Made Keylogger:**
- Degraded **screenshot quality**
- Slowed **web browsing** or **system performance**
- **Input lag** in mouse movements or keystrokes
- Unexpected **graphics errors** or loading issues

### 🛡️ **Well-Designed Keyloggers:**
- Run **flawlessly** with no noticeable performance impact
- Disguise network traffic as **normal files** or **legitimate traffic**
- May display a **monitoring notice** (corporate environments)
- Some can **reinstall themselves** if removed

### ✅ **Best Protection Practices:**
- Use **reputable antivirus/anti-malware** software with:
  - **Heuristic analysis**
  - **Signature recognition**
  - **Behavioral detection** (keystroke/screenshot monitoring)
- Perform **regular system scans**

## 🛡️ **Staying Safe: Prevention Tips**
### 🔄 **Keep Software Updated**
- Regularly update your **OS, applications, and browsers**

### 📎 **Be Cautious with Attachments**
- Avoid opening **unexpected attachments**, even from known contacts
- **Verify with the sender** if in doubt

### 🔑 **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**
- Create **long, complex passwords**
- **Never reuse passwords** across services

### 🛠️ **Employ Real-Time Protection**
- Use **always-on antivirus/anti-malware** protection
- Cover **all devices & platforms** (Windows, Android, macOS, iOS)
